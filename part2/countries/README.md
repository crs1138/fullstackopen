# Countries

This folder contains the first set of exercises for the Part 2 (React)
within the Fullstack Open course.

It is not meant for production.

## Contribution

1. Run `npm install` inside of the `courseinfo` folder.
2. Create your own `.env` and set the value of the `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API` using
   your own API key generated at
   [Open Weather Map - API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
    ```
    # WEATHER API (paid service)
    REACT_APP_WEATHER_API=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
3. Run `npm start` to start developing

## Notes

The `db.json` file is not used, it was a part of the development process. I left
it in the repo for debugging purposes.
